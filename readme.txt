Assignment 4 - Declan Best

I create all the files using JSP so I could use Java code if I desired so all the location names will be different,
additionally ... index.jsp is named home.jsp in my project.

This project is currently running on port 2080... so the Google Sign In API is expecting http://localhost:2080 

Screen Resolution (page is semi-responsive so maybe try and get it all to look good because I promise there is a resolution that does!)
	
	Browser window size: 1255 x 914
	Screen size: 1920 x 1080
	
	from: https://browsersize.com/
	
Created and tested in Google Chrome browser.

Default sort method is 'best_match'

**GOOGLE SIGN IN BROWSER ERROR
For whatever reason, if there is a user currently signed into Google and then proceeds to use Google Sign In.. it fails with an error message from Google.
If this is the case, you can run the website on another browser and the Google functionality will work fine (although graphics may be off as I tested
all front-end using Chrome, I am finding out about this sign on problem last minute and this can serve as a fix to test that part of the assignment.)
